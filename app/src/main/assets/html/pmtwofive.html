<b>PM 2.5</b><br/>

<p>Particles less than 2.5 micrometer in diameter are referred to as “fine” particles. Sources of PM2.5 includes all types of combustion, including motor vehicles, power plants, residential wood burning, forest fires, agricultural burning, and some industrial processes.
Short-term exposure to high level of fine particles can cause symptoms such as eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, coughing, and shortness of breath. Long-term exposure can affect lung function and worsen medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease, and may lead to lung cancer.
